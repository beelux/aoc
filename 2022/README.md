# Advent of Code 2022
## Reason
This year, as bad as the quick code might end up being, I'll archive it in a Git repository.

No more losing old code.

## Goal
Maybe finally understanding Python.
If I end up giving up, maybe I'll try doing it with C++ or hell... C.
If the worst were to happen, I might have to resort to Java o_O.
